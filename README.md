# Djikstra-explorer
Visualization of the Djikstra algorithm. Accessible at droplet.cz/network

Controls:\n
'd' - step by step exploration process of the graph\n
'r' - clear the leftovers after the exploration, i.e. visualization of the accessible nodes\n

Tweaking:\n
At the top of graph.js, there are tweaking variables, namely for the number of nodes, switching to an undirected graph and changing the source node.

Enjoy!
