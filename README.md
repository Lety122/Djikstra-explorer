# Djikstra-explorer
Visualization of the Djikstra algorithm. Accessible at droplet.cz/network

Controls:
'd' - step by step exploration process of the graph
'r' - clear the leftovers after the exploration, i.e. visualization of the accessible nodes

Tweaking:
At the top of graph.js, there are tweaking variables, namely for the number of nodes, switch to an undirected graph and change the source node.

Enjoy!
